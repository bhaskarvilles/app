/// The base Presenter
///
/// The base Presenter is the basic abstraction for all Presenters. A Presenter
/// is used by a [UseCase] to build its User Interface.
///
/// Rather than using this abstraction to constrict the implementation of
/// presenters, the goal is to use inversion of control in the implementation
/// to have a decoupled code, based in vertical implementations.
